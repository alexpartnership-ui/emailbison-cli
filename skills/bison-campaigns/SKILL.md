```bash
# Full campaign launch workflow
CAMPAIGN=$(bison campaigns create --name "Q2 Outreach" | jq -r '.data.id')
bison campaigns update --id "$CAMPAIGN" --max_emails_per_day 200 --open_tracking
bison campaigns attach-sender-emails --campaign_id "$CAMPAIGN" --sender_email_ids '["se1","se2"]'
bison campaigns attach-leads --campaign_id "$CAMPAIGN" --lead_ids '["l1","l2","l3"]'
bison campaigns resume --campaign_id "$CAMPAIGN"

# Pause all active campaigns and check stats
for CID in $(bison campaigns list | jq -r '.data[] | select(.status=="active") | .id'); do
  bison campaigns pause --campaign_id "$CID"
  bison campaigns stats --campaign_id "$CID" | jq '{id: .data.id, sent: .data.sent, replies: .data.replies}'
done

# Duplicate a campaign and reassign to new leads
NEW=$(bison campaigns duplicate --campaign_id <source_id> | jq -r '.data.id')
bison campaigns remove-leads --campaign_id "$NEW" --lead_ids '["old1","old2"]'
bison campaigns attach-leads --campaign_id "$NEW" --lead_ids '["new1","new2"]'
bison campaigns resume --campaign_id "$NEW"

# Move unresponsive leads to a nurture campaign
bison campaigns move-leads --campaign_id <source_id> --lead_ids '["l1","l2"]' --to_campaign_id <nurture_id>

# Stop future emails for a lead who replied out-of-band

```
