```bash
# Inbox triage workflow — process all unread replies
for RID in $(bison replies list --is-read false | jq -r '.data[].id'); do
  echo "--- Reply: $RID ---"
  bison replies get "$RID" --pretty

  # Read the full thread for context
  bison replies conversation-thread "$RID" --pretty

  # Mark as read after reviewing
  bison replies mark-read-unread "$RID" --is-read true
done

# Auto-classify out-of-office replies as automated
for RID in $(bison replies list --is-read false | jq -r '.data[] | select(.subject | test("out of office|OOO|auto.reply"; "i")) | .id'); do
  bison replies mark-automated "$RID" --is-automated true
  bison replies mark-read-unread "$RID" --is-read true
done

# Route interested replies to a follow-up campaign
FOLLOWUP_ID="<followup_campaign_id>"
for RID in $(bison replies list --is-read false | jq -r '.data[].id'); do
  BODY=$(bison replies get "$RID" | jq -r '.data.body_text // ""')
  # Mark interested if reply contains positive signals
