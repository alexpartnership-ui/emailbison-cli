bison leads list | jq '.total'

# Get all reply subjects for a lead
bison leads replies <lead_id> | jq '.data[] | {subject, received_at}'
```

## common patterns

```bash
# Bulk import from CSV and assign to campaign
CAMPAIGN_ID="<campaign_id>"
bison leads bulk-csv \
  --csv "$(cat leads.csv)" \
  --campaign-id "$CAMPAIGN_ID"

# Upsert a batch of enriched leads
bison leads create-or-update-multiple --leads "$(cat enriched-leads.json)"

# Pause all leads that have bounced
BOUNCED=$(bison leads list | jq -r '[.data[] | select(.status=="bounced") | .id]')
bison leads bulk-update-status --lead-ids "$BOUNCED" --status paused

# Find leads with replies and export
for LID in $(bison leads list | jq -r '.data[].id'); do
  REPLY_COUNT=$(bison leads replies "$LID" | jq '.data | length')
  if [ "$REPLY_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "$LID has $REPLY_COUNT replies"
  fi
done

# Unsubscribe leads in bulk by iterating
for LID in id1 id2 id3; do
  bison leads unsubscribe "$LID"
done

# Full lead lifecycle: create, assign, track
LEAD=$(bison leads create --email prospect@target.com --first-name Sarah --company-name "Target Corp" | jq -r '.data.id')
bison campaigns attach-leads --campaign_id <campaign_id> --lead_ids "[\"$LEAD\"]"
# Later: check activity
